## 🙌 Introduction

Welcome to my personal website! This digital space is a reflection of my passion for web development, design, and technology. Here, I share my journey of crafting a seamless and engaging user experience using Astro.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

In the ever-evolving realm of web development, my personal website stands as a testament to the fusion of cutting-edge technologies. Built with Astro.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this space embodies the seamless integration of server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR), creating an optimal user experience.

## Features

### 📝 Blogs

### 🎨 Projects
My digital gallery, where I showcase a selection of awesome projects I've had the pleasure of working on.

## 🚀 Getting Started 
To begin, you need to follow the instructions

**1. Clone using git**
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/ivalshamkya/ivalshamkya.com.git
```
**2. Install dependencies**
```zsh
pnpm install
```
**3. Start the dev server**
```zsh
pnpm dev 
```

The default port for the Astro development server is `4321`. This means that when you run the astro dev command, the development server will start up and listen for connections on port `4321`.
Open http://localhost:4321 with your browser to see the result.
